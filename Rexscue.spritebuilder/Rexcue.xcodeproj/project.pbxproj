Have you ever been hit by a flying ball of yarn? Me too. Maybe it hit you in your face. It wasn’t too bad, was it? The soft thread lightly ricocheting off of your well-moisturized cheek, bouncing gently onto your grandparents’ somewhat musky shag carpet. It was almost refreshing, wasn’t it?

Well what if the ball of yarn was on fire? And you were a dinosaur? And there were VOLCANOES? And all the while you were trying to deal with other EVIL DINOSAURS? That’s right, evil dinosaurs (you don’t hate them, you just hate their behavior). Doesn’t sound so appealing anymore, does it?

Here’s where you come in. Save your pack of lovable yarn T-Rexes, Stegosauruses, Pterodactyls, and many more from incoming yarn-meteors and other evil yarn-dinos, all while progressing through the various eras of these magnificent beasts’ existence. Their survival depends on your help.

You might call the endeavor a… T-yarnasaurus Rexscue.

We sure did.
